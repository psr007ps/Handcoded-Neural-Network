# Handcoded-Neural-Network
Handcoded Artificial Neural Network for classifying digits less than or equal to 4 or greater than 4 

Goals:

output 1 if the input image is a digit greater than 4 (i.e. digits 5,6,7,8,9).

output 0 if the input image is a digit less than or equal to 4 (i.e. digits 0,1,2,3,4).


Neural net form: f(x) = Ïƒ(vT ReLU(W x)).
